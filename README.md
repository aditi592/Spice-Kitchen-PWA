# SpicyKitchen

This is a mini-project for college.
Project Built on Angular as the front end and Node.js as the backend and MongoDb as the database which is on the cloud(but cluster not available now).

# Description

This project is created to allow you to place an order from Zomato API but unfortunately Zomato doesnt provide one for now.
So we have a login and register screen where a user would Login/Register and then they would be allow to see the menu template that is static and view other details about the restaurant.

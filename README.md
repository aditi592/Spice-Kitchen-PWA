# SpicyKitchen

This is a mini-project for college.
Project Built on Angular as the front end and Node.js as the backend and MongoDb as the database which is on the cloud(but cluster not available now).

# Description

This project is created to allow you to place an order from Zomato API but unfortunately Zomato doesnt provide one for now.
So we have a login and register screen where a user would Login/Register and then they would be allow to see the menu template that is static and view other details about the restaurant.

# Description

If you want to try this project: 
  1. The branch that needs to be pulled is "Final" *Dont judge*
  2. clone this repo
  3. npm install insde the "Spicy-Kitchen-PWA" folder to get the modules for Angular
  4. Inside the "Spicy-Kitchen-PWA" folder there is a server folder which contains the backend (NodeJs Code) which then again you need to run npm install to get the NodeJs code running. 
  5. Inside the server folder you will have to change the path for the MongoDb Cluster Path -> MONGODB_URI => "Spice-Kitchen-PWA/server/config/config.json"
  6. Thats it.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.
